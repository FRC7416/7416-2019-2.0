Welcome to the 7416 Northern Horizons 2019 robot code, written by Eric Norfleet and Nathan Bush
This code runs our robot Murphy, who can mount first level hatch panels and climb to the second platform
As this is our rookie year, we lack advanced features like vision processing and auto code, but we're proud of what we have
If you have any questions about this code, you can catch me (Eric) on discord as Regime#8405 or at my email adress theericnorfleet@gmail.com
